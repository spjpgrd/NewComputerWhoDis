komputer maschine
======

komputer maschine is a shell script that gets your machine ready for design and development.

This script can be ran once or as many times as you'd like. It installs everything that macOS needs to get to work.

## Requirements

* A komputer maschine
* macOS (>10)

## Install

```sh
curl --remote-name https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spjpgrd/komputer-maschine/master/macos
sh macos 2>&1 | tee ~/komputer-maschine.log
```

## Debugging

The log of your script, successful or not, will be saved to `~/komputer-maschine.log`.

Read through it to see if you can debug the issue yourself.
If not, report where the script failed into a [new GitHub Issue](https://github.com/laurendorman/komputer-maschine/issues/new).
